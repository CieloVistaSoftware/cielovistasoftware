# LINKEDIN TEASER POST (Use as Main Post Text)
## Version 1.0 - November 14, 2025

## VERSION 1: MYSTERY HOOK (Recommended)

All 20 tests passing ✓
94% code coverage ✓
Zero linting errors ✓
Clean type checking ✓
Professional code structure ✓

Every quality indicator was green.

Within 24 hours of deployment, every single production scenario failed.

I conducted a controlled experiment to understand why AI-generated code with perfect metrics can fail completely in production.

The results surprised me:
• AI-Only: 0/10 production scenarios passing (128 hours total)
• Systematic: 10/10 production scenarios passing (80 hours total)

The 10x time investment delivered 37% faster time to production readiness.

Here's what happened, the data, and the framework that prevents disasters 👇

## VERSION 2: DIRECT CONFRONTATION

Hot take: Green tests don't mean production-ready.

I just finished a controlled experiment that proves it:

✓ AI generated perfect-looking code in 8 hours
✓ All tests passing
✓ High code coverage
✓ Zero linting errors

Production readiness: 0/10 scenarios passing

Here's the systematic framework that caught 23 critical bugs BEFORE production 👇

## VERSION 3: THE NUMBERS STORY

128 hours vs 80 hours to production-ready code.

Which development approach is faster?

Plot twist: The 80-hour approach.

I rebuilt the same e-commerce checkout feature twice:
• AI-Only: 8 hours dev + 120 hours firefighting
• Systematic: 80 hours dev + 0 hours firefighting

The 10x investment in systematic verification eliminated all production failures.

## VERSION 4: THE QUESTION HOOK

"Why did our AI-generated code fail in production when all tests passed?"

This question led me to conduct a controlled experiment:

Same feature. Two approaches. 10 production scenarios.

Results:
• AI-Only: 0/10 passing
• Systematic: 10/10 passing

The gap? Systematic verification.

Here's the complete breakdown of what we learned 👇

## VERSION 5: THE CONFESSION

I trusted AI-generated code. All tests passed. I deployed to production.

Everything failed.

Here's what a 4-day controlled experiment taught me about AI-assisted development:

• AI introduces regressions at 1 per 9.4 commits
• 94% code coverage ≠ production ready
• Mocks hide 83% more failure modes than real systems
• Quality metrics are lagging indicators

## QUICK ENGAGEMENT STARTERS

After posting, comment on your own post with:

"Quick context: This experiment was part of our work at CieloVista Software building production systems. The 8-test boundary formula alone caught 67 bugs that AI-generated tests missed.

What's been your experience with AI-generated code? Have you caught issues that passed all tests?"

This seeds the conversation and gives people an easy entry point to engage.
